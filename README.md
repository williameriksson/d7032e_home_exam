## Compile and run
The project contains compiled .class files in the ./bin directory. Just run them from
the ./bin directory by `java ltu.monopoly.Main [Your name]`.

If you want to compile the code and are on a Linux distribution (or OSX should also work), just run `sh compile.sh` which will compile both the code and the tests. To run the tests, run `sh unittest.sh`.
